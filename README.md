# googleServices_py3_examples  
Just some utility tools to use Google Services with Python 3 on Linux.  
## emailMeFile.py  
This can be used from terminal to quickly send a quick file by email.  
You will need to change the recipients, sender and password variables in the script.  
You need to set up the sending gmail account to accept unsecure apps.   
I recommend creating a new one as your credentials will be written in the script. Security, you know...  
The script can be run with the file you want to send as an argument.  
e.g.  
$ python3 emailMeFile.py filename.txt  
More docs and tools to come.
